    "The `.similarity_search` method in the previous code is used to find the most relevant text chunks from a pre-processed document that are similar to a given query. Here's how it works step-by-step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Processing and Embedding:**\n",
    "   - The document `state_of_the_union.txt` is loaded using the `TextLoader` from the LangChain Community package.\n",
    "   - The document is then split into smaller chunks of text using the `CharacterTextSplitter`, where each chunk is 1000 characters long without any overlap between the chunks.\n",
    "   - Each chunk of text is then transformed into an embedding using `OpenAIEmbeddings`. Embeddings are high-dimensional vectors that represent the semantic content of the text.\n",
    "   - These embeddings are stored in an instance of `Chroma`, which serves as a vector database optimized for efficient similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `.similarity_search`:**\n",
    "   - When you invoke `vector_db.similarity_search(question)`, the method converts the query (`\"What did the president say about the John Lewis Voting Rights Act?\"`) into an embedding using the same method that was used for the chunks.\n",
    "   - It then searches the vector database (`vector_db`) to find the chunks whose embeddings are most similar to the embedding of the query. This similarity is typically measured using metrics such as cosine similarity.\n",
    "   - The search results are sorted by relevance, with the most relevant chunks (those that are semantically closest to the query) returned first.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output:**\n",
    "   - The result of the `.similarity_search` is stored in `response`, which contains the relevant chunks and their similarity scores.\n",
    "   - The script prints the content of the most relevant chunk (the first result), which should ideally contain information about what the president said regarding the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly useful in applications like question answering or document retrieval where you need to quickly find the most relevant parts of a large text based on a query."
