    "Here’s what each part of the chain does, in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieving Relevant Documents**: First, the system retrieves documents that are relevant to the question you ask. It uses a retriever which is designed to find the most relevant information based on the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Formatting Documents**: Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the next step is to format them into a readable format. The function `format_docs` does this by taking the content of each document and separating them with two newline spaces. This creates a clear and organized chunk of text that serves as the context for answering the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preparing the Prompt**: With the context formatted, the system uses a template to prepare the prompt for the AI model. The template structures the input by placing the formatted context first and then the question. This way, the AI model knows exactly what the background information is and what it needs to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating the Answer**: The structured prompt is then fed into an AI model, in this case, ChatOpenAI. The AI reads the combined context and question and generates an answer based on what it knows from the provided text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extracting the Final Answer**: Finally, the response from the AI is parsed into a straightforward text format using `StrOutputParser`, making it easy to read and understand. This step ensures that what you get as the output is just the answer, cleaned up from any formatting or raw data that the AI might output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this code automates the process of fetching relevant information, preparing it, and asking an AI to provide a clear answer based on that information. It's like setting up a mini question-answering system where the AI has all the necessary context to provide accurate responses."
