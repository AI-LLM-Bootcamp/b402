    "Here's a simple explanation of what's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`search_kwargs={\"k\": 1}`**: This parameter is being set when the retriever object is created from the vector database. Here, `k` stands for the number of results or documents to retrieve that are most similar to the query. By setting `k` to 1, the code specifies that the retriever should return only the single most relevant document or chunk of text in response to a query. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you use this parameter:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It tells the retriever to limit the number of retrieved documents to the top 1 most relevant result.\n",
    "- **Usage**: This is particularly useful when you are only interested in the very best match for a query and not in other closely related matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, when the retriever is invoked with the query about what was said regarding \"ketanji brown jackson\", it will only return the single most relevant piece of information or document from the database, rather than providing several possible answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is useful for applications where clarity and precision are more valuable than breadth, such as when you need a concise answer to a specific question without additional context that might be slightly less relevant."
